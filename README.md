Sether is platform that provides blockchain integration with social
network APIs, allowing any blockchain enterprise to communicate, get
information, analyze and monitor social networks.

### SETH
The SETH token is a standard ERC20 token that can be used by multiple wallets and
trading platforms.
The token will be used as the only currency for interacting with the Sether platform.
